# BatchComputerRemoval
This batch script offers an efficient solution for removing specified computer accounts from an Active Directory domain. By providing a list of computer names, the script iterates through the list, using the "dsrm" command to delete each corresponding computer account from the domain's directory structure. The script's simplicity and automation streamline the process of managing computer accounts in a centralized manner, making it an invaluable tool for network administrators seeking to maintain an organized and up-to-date domain environment.
